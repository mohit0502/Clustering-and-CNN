# Clustering, PCA, and CNN Project

This project demonstrates the application of clustering techniques, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for analyzing and modeling datasets. The goal is to explore data, reduce dimensions, cluster samples, and implement deep learning models.

## Project Overview

### Objectives
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- Use clustering techniques to group data.
- Implement CNNs for image classification.
- Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy and silhouette score.

### Tools and Libraries
The following tools and libraries were used in this project:
- **NumPy, Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For preprocessing, PCA, and clustering.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For deep learning models.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Data Source

This project utilizes data from the [Simpsons MNIST Dataset](https://github.com/alvarobartt/simpsons-mnist) created by [Álvaro Bartolomé](https://github.com/alvarobartt). 

The dataset includes images of characters from "The Simpsons" series and is used for exploratory analysis, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and CNN modeling in this project.

### Acknowledgment
Special thanks to the authors for providing the dataset. The original dataset and related materials can be found [here](https://github.com/alvarobartt/simpsons-mnist).

## Results

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA retained 90% variance with reduced dimensions.
- **Clustering**: Silhouette analysis was used to determine optimal clusters.
- **Image Classification**: CNNs were implemented and evaluated using metrics like accuracy and loss.
